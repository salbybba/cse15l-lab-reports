# Lab Report 5

## Finding the differences 
To find the tests with different results, I used `vimdiff` after running a bash for loop and putting the results in a .txt file. This made the search much more autonomous and easy. By doing this process, I found that the two implementations differed in many files, but I have chosen to look at test 22 and 496

**In the screenshots below, the left side is the results of the provided implementation while the right side is the results of my group's implementation.**
    
## [Test 22](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/22.md)

I don't believe that either implementation produces the correct output. I think the correct output would be **/bar\***. This is the link shown in VSCode. I think the bug in my group's implementation is the oversight of a title. The implementation should include a part in the code that ensures there are no quotation marks indicating a title. Adding a method that checks for quotation marks should fix this issue. 

## [Test 496](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/496.md)

I believe that the provided implementation had the correct output, with no links. When I look at the preview of this file in VSCode, there is no link shown.
