## Change 2

Test [file](https://github.com/DanUCSD/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-break.md)

We made this change in order to account for if the link had other parentheses within it. The test file had a link with several pairs of parentheses, which caused a symptom in the previous code. This was fixed by the change we made.


## Change 3

Test [file](https://github.com/DanUCSD/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-empty.md)

We made this change because the changes we made to the code would not account for if the file was empty. This was not a bug in the original code, but we needed to add this part to our code to ensure that it would not be a new bug.
